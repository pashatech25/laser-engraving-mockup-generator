# Product Context â€” Real Estate Media SaaS (Multi-tenant)

## Vision
Deliver a multi-tenant SaaS for real estate media companies to sell services, schedule staff, manage bookings, deliver media, and publish branded/unbranded property pages.

## Tenancy Model
- Multi-tenant: every organization (tenant) manages its own services, pricing, packages, calendars, staff, customers, and websites.
- Platform-level configuration (env/secrets) enables core services (e.g., Stripe, S3, Google OAuth). Per-tenant business data lives in the database and is set via Admin UI.

## Scope (MVP)
- Authentication (login/registration), organization onboarding
- Services and categories; pricing modes (flat fee or sqft-based tiers)
- Pricing groups, customer groups, coupons
- Packages with flat/percent discounts and per-item display price overrides (showcase-only)
- Booking + team calendar + appointment intervals + buffers + rescheduling
- Per-staff Google Calendar sync; organization-level Google integration
- Staff auto-assign (toggleable) or customer staff pick (toggle)
- Territories/service areas; travel/buffer rules
- Stripe payments (deposits, balances) and invoicing (PDF)
- S3 media upload; one-link download center; Google Drive/Dropbox export
- Property websites (2+ templates), builder blocks, branded/unbranded publish

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Native mobile app, payroll/HRIS integration, advanced analytics, marketplace, template marketplace.

## Personas
- Owner/Admin, Scheduler, Staff/Photographer, Accounting, Customer (Agent/Team)

## API (MVP)
- Reference: full OpenAPI spec lives at `openapi/openapi.yaml`

  - Supabase Auth for sessions/JWT. Optionally keep `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` for server-managed flows.
- Organizations
  - GET `/organizations/me`

  - GET/POST `/services/{id}/tiers`
  - GET/POST `/pricing-groups`, POST `/pricing-groups/{id}/rules`

  - GET/POST `/customers`
  - GET/POST `/customer-groups`

  - POST `/quote` (compute totals with tiers/groups/coupons)
  - GET `/availability` (slots by date/services)
- Bookings & Calendar
  - POST `/bookings`, GET/PATCH `/bookings/{id}`

## Database (Supabase)
- Supabase Postgres with RLS by `org_id`, aligned to `docs/ERD.mmd`.
- Use Supabase client on the frontend and server-side service role for privileged ops.
- Migrations and policies maintained in SQL (`safe-migration.sql` and related files).

## UI/UX baseline
- Booking flow screens (you will provide images) are the design source of truth.
- We will extract tokens (color, type scale, spacing, radii, shadows) and core components (buttons, inputs, selects, cards, tabs, modals, calendar/time-picker, stepper, toast) and apply consistently across Admin, Customer, and Delivery areas.

## Phasing
- Phase 1 (MVP): Auth, services/tiers/groups, bookings/calendar, Stripe deposits, invoices, S3 uploads, download center, property sites (2 templates), Google Calendar, basic payouts
- Phase 2: Packages (display overrides), coupons, territories, auto-assign, Drive/Dropbox export, branded/unbranded toggles, builder blocks expansion, CubiCasa
- Phase 3: Reporting, payroll integrations, template marketplace, advanced analytics
